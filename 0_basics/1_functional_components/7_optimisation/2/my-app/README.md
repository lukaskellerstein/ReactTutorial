Fluent UI

## NEW FUNCTIONALITIES

- in comparison with previous optimisation sample app we've added:
  - implement remove of products
  - login-form is using Refs instead of state

## Problems in application

1. Duplicated logic - showing Errors

- between files login-form and product-pages

2. More readable code - Use Reducer instead of use State
